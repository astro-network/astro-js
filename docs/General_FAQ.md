# What is Whuffie?

# What can I do with Whuffie?
- any currency or token that can be issued and sent between accounts can be implemented on top of Whuffie, such as:
  - social network and reputation currencies
  - rewards points systems
  - video game credits/tokens
  - community currencies & mutual credit systems
  - charity and volunteering incentive systems
  - basic income credit systems

# How does Whuffie compare to Ripple/Stellar?
- Like Ripple and Stellar, Whuffie allows users to issue arbitrary currencies and credits, choose whose credits to accept, and will trade them along multiple offers during a single transaction if necessary. There are, however, a few key differences:
  - it operates as a smart contract on Ethereum, and thus the routing capabilities are limited by the gas limit on transactions
  - the contracts can be updated (and/or additional contracts can be implemented) to include more advanced trading features more easily than in either cryptocurrency software
  - no KYC/AML restrictions are baked into the code

# Whuffie sounds like a decentralized exchange, so how does it compare to EtherEx?
- an exchange like EtherEx could be implemented on top of Whuffie, capable of trading tokens and currencies over multiple offers thru the Whuffie engine
- Whuffie tokens and credits that implement the ERC20 token interface should be tradeable on EtherEx
- other non-whuffie tokens and smart contract currencies would have to be pegged to a Whuffie token contract equivalent, though further research is required to work out the details.
