A crypto-asset network, exchange and API, built on Ethereum and Solidity.

With Nanex, you can seamlessly trade, exchange and issue custom p2p crypto-assets (or any other kind of assets, currencies, credits, or tokens) and soon, Nanex will support migrating your balances of existing Ethereum ERC20 tokens into and out of Nanex. 


### Note:

:warning: Nanex is currently in active development, experimental and untested. :warning:

About
-----

Nanex implements the minimum subset of features required for all assets, currencies, credits, and tokens (i.e. issuance, transference, and exchange), therefore, you can use it to implement **any kind of asset, currency, token, credit system you want** or even your own **higher-level platforms** on the Nanex network. Examples of what can be built with Nanex include:

- crowdsale, ICO and DAO tokens
- synthetic and decentralized assets
- in-game credits
- rewards/loyalty point systems
- social network and reputation currencies
- charity and volunteering incentive systems
- a full-blown currency/commodity exchange
- mutual credit and community currencies (with or without demurrage)
- a low-level, fully-p2p replacement for ACH, SWIFT, MasterCard *and* Visa transaction networks
- custom basic income systems

... and because we've included a path-finding algorithm to traverse over everyone's open offers (i.e. trades between assets), **any of your assets can now be transferred** from one user to another, **even if the recipient doesn't accept the asset you're sending**.

Components
