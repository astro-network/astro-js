Contribution Guides
--------------------------------------

In the spirit of open source software development, jQuery always encourages community code contribution. To help you get started and before you jump into writing code, be sure to read these important contribution guidelines thoroughly:

1. [Getting Involved](http://contribute.jquery.org/)
2. [Core Style Guide](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/)
3. [Writing Code for jQuery Foundation Projects](http://contribute.jquery.org/code/)


Environments in which to use jQuery
--------------------------------------

- [Browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/) differs between the master branch and the compat branch. Specifically, the master branch does not support legacy browsers such as IE8. The jQuery team continues to provide support for legacy browsers on the compat branch. Use the latest compat release if support for those browsers is required. See [browser support](http://jquery.com/browser-support/) for more info.
- To use jQuery in Node, browser extensions, and other non-browser environments, use only master branch releases given the name "jquery" rather than "jquery-compat". The compat branch does not support these environments.

Build your own local version of Whuffie on OS X
--------------------------------------

First, you will need to have Meteor and Neo4j installed, which you can do by running these commands (requires [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)):
```bash
curl https://install.meteor.com | /bin/sh   # installs Meteor and MongoDB
brew install neo4j                          # installs neo4j
```

After installing Meteor, clone down the repo:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/sunny-g/whuffie
```

Install and build the dependencies (currently only stellar-lib):
```bash
cd .gulp
npm install
gulp
```

Go back to the root directory and run Neo4j and Meteor!
```bash
neo4j start
meteor
```

Note: 
-----
Whuffie is currently an ugly, pre-alpha WIP to be seen and used by no one.
